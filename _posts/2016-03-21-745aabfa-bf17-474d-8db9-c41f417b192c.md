# Important Questions

1\. Do you know exactly what would happen to your family if you didn't wake up tomorrow?

2\. Do you know what would happen to you and your family's finances if you became disabled and could no longer work?

3\. Who will you need to, or would want to help educate? Have you projected possible costs?

4\. How and when do you see yourself retiring? What will you do? What will it cost to do it-not just the day after you retire but 10, 20 maybe even 30 years later?
